### Bridge design pattern

Bridge is a structural design pattern that divides business logic or huge class into separate class hierarchies that can be developed independently.

1) When we want a parent abstract class to define the set of basic rules, and the concrete classes to add additional rules
2) When we have an abstract class that has a reference to the objects, and it has abstract methods that will be defined in each of the concrete classes
