### Template design pattern

It makes it easier to implement complex algorithms by encapsulating logic in a single method.

This pattern is widely used in the Java core libraries, for example by java.util.AbstractList, or java.util.AbstractSet.

For instance, Abstract List provides a skeletal implementation of the List interface.
